<h1>Population Migration from State to State</h1>

<aside>Mouseover to focus on rides to or from a single neighbor&shy;hood.

<p>The thickness of links be&shy;tween neighborhoods encodes the relative frequency of rides between two neighborhoods: thicker links represent more frequent rides.

<p>Links are directed: for exam&shy;ple, while 2.2% of rides go from South of Market to Downtown, only 1.2% go in the opposite direction. Links are colored by the more fre&shy;quent origin.
