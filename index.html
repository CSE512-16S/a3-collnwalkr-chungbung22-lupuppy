  <h1>Population Migration from State to State</h1>

<aside>Mouseover to focus on the number of people moving from one state to another.

<p>The thickness of links between states encodes the relative frequency of moves between two states: thicker links represent more people moving. 

<p>Links are directed: for example, while 2.2% of rides go from South of Market to Downtown, only 1.2% go in the opposite direction. Links are colored by the more frequent origin.
