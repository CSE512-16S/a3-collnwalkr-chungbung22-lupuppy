  <h1>Population Migration from State to State 2014-2015</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The thickness of links between states encodes the relative frequency of moves between two states: thicker links represent more people moving. The thickness from outgoing paths represent the number of people leaving a state, while the thickness of incoming paths represent the people entering the state. This is shared on the same path, but is encoded with a change in path width, where the path connects to the state</p>
  <p>The line color represents the region that the selected state is part of, with different colored paths representing a larger number of people moving from another state, into the selected state</p>
  <p>The paths and text labels for each state can be hovered over, which reveals a tooltip that includes the number of people moving into and out of a state along each path, and the total number of people leaving a state and the current number of residents along each state label. </p>
